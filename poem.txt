1) O say can you see 
2) By the dawn's early light
3) What so proudly we hailed 
4) At the twilight's last gleaming
5) Whose broad stripes and bright stars 
6) Through the perilous fight
7) O'er the ramparts we watched, 
8) Were so gallantly streaming?
9) And the rocket's red glare, 
10) The bombs bursting in air
11) Gave proof through the night 
12) That our flag was still there
13) O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
14) O'er the land of the free 
15) And the home of the brave
